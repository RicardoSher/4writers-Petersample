By learning some important spelling rules, you will be able to prepare brilliant papers.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Covid-19 or COVID-19: Which Spelling Is Correct?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>In the present-day realms, this question is very relevant. When you are writing a paper about this disease, you need to use \u201cCOVID-19\u201d or \u201ccoronavirus disease.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Coronavirus disease or COVID-19 are the official names formulated by the World Health Organization. At the same time, in many publications, one can also find the spelling \u201cCovid-19.\u201d As The Guardian\u2019s experts explain it, a lot of article writers use uppercase for abbreviations that are pronounced as a collection of letters. With time, acronyms can be pronounced as words so that we can notice Unicef, Nasa, and now, Covid-19.<\/p>\n<p>In some dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster or Oxford Learner\u2019s dictionary, one can see that Covid-19 is used as an alternative to COVID-19. Consequently, one can assume that \u201cCovid-19 vs. COVID-19\u201d will become a subject for further linguistic debates.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, it is worth saying that the WHO accepts only one version, \u201cCOVID-19.\u201d Nevertheless, when you see \u201cCovid-19\u201d in newspapers, there is no need to correct it because many reputed sources use this version. Therefore, one can conclude that both options are correct.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>How to Improve Spelling: Efficient Tools<\/strong><\/h4>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Use a trusted dictionary<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>Even if you are a good writer, you cannot rely solely on the ability of your brain to memorize difficult-to-spell words. To spell your words correctly, you need to look for a good and up-to-date dictionary. Although there are many dictionaries available, both print and online versions, you need to use the best one. You need to always follow the rules applicable to specific spelling conventions (for example, UK or US spelling) and consult with a dictionary offering this spelling. Whenever you need to use Canadian spelling in your paper, you need to find a dictionary that provides Canadian spellings.<\/p>\n<p>Non-native speakers can take advantage of using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com\/\"><em>Oxford<\/em>\u00a0<\/a><em>Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary<\/em> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ldoceonline.com\/\"><em>Longman<\/em>\u00a0<em>Dictionary of Contemporary English<\/em><\/a><em>,<\/em> as they contain useful information about the context, which requires specific words. Consequently, they help to understand which words are more appropriate in various situations.<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Be consistent about your spelling<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>Whenever you use American, British, or Canadian spelling in your paper, you should be consistent in doing it. Whereas Canadians often prefer the British <em><strong>\u2013our<\/strong><\/em> ending in words like <em>colour <\/em>or <em>harbour<\/em>, the American <em><strong>\u2013or<\/strong><\/em> endings can also be used. The same rule is applied to the <strong>\u2013<\/strong><em><strong>re<\/strong><\/em><strong>\/-<\/strong><em><strong>er<\/strong><\/em><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>endings, for example, <em>theatre\/theater<\/em> or <em>centre\/center<\/em>. Canadian spelling prefers the British <strong><em>\u2013re<\/em><\/strong> ending, though American <strong><em>\u2013er <\/em><\/strong>ending is also acceptable. At the same time, Canadians use the American convention of using <strong><em>\u2013<\/em><\/strong><em><strong>ize<\/strong><\/em><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>ending instead of \u2013-<em><strong>ise<\/strong><\/em><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>ending for words like\u00a0<em>hypothesize <\/em><em>or<\/em><em> scrutinize<\/em>, though the <strong>\u2013<\/strong><em><strong>ise<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0ending is also acceptable. If you want to make your audience enjoy reading your paper, you need to be consistent about the spelling you use. This means that you should not combine the <strong><em>\u2013our <\/em><\/strong>and <strong><em>\u2013or <\/em><\/strong>or <strong><em>\u2013ise <\/em><\/strong>and <strong><em>\u2013ize <\/em><\/strong>endings in your paper.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>Useful tip:<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you add suffixes to words ending in <strong><em>\u2013our<\/em><\/strong>, it is necessary to drop the <em>u<\/em>: not <em>humourous <\/em>but<em> humorous<\/em>, not <em>honourary <\/em>but<em> honorary<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Make sure to pay attention to \u201ctroublesome\u201d suffixes<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>There are some suffixes in the English language that confuse the most skilled writers. If you have any doubts regarding the suffixes that you should use in your paper, you need to check them when editing your work.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>-ible or -able (-ibility or -ability, -ibly or -ably): reliable \/ responsible, reliably \/ responsibly; reliability \/ responsibility;<\/li>\n<li>-ance or -ence or:\u00a0 <em>importance<\/em><em>\/\u00a0<\/em><em>dependence;<\/em><\/li>\n<li>-cial or -tial: beneficial \/ partial.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Pay attention to homophones and other confusable words<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>You probably know that a lot of English words have different spelling but similar pronunciations. If you utilize the inappropriate word from a homophone pair, you will commit the most common spelling mistake. Therefore, to improve your writing proficiency, you need to check the common types of typically misspelled words when proofreading your paper:<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>For example:<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proceed\/precede;<\/li>\n<li>Except\/accept;<\/li>\n<li>Here\/hear;<\/li>\n<li>Which\/witch.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Use your computer spell checker, but do not rely solely on the software<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>Of course, you can use your computer spell-checking software as a tool for noticing spelling mistakes. It will help you catch any words or word combinations that are not natural for the English language. However, we strongly recommend you not to rely on this software too much because it can miss a lot of misspelled words that form another English word, for example <em>whose<\/em> instead of <em>who\u2019s<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you rely on your automatic spell-checking tool, you can become inattentive to spelling mistakes when you write your paper and edit it. As a result, you will find it too difficult to recognize correct spelling.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of using the automatic spell-checking software, you should develop your writing intuition. For example, you can turn your spell-checker off and try to revise your paper without it. Then, you may need to turn it on and compare the results. By using this strategy regularly, you will pay attention to the mistakes you tend to commit habitually, which will increase your chances of producing high-quality papers.<\/p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Learn common English spelling rules<\/strong><\/span><\/h5>\n<p>You should know that English spelling usually follows certain rules. If you want to succeed in academic writing, you need to be aware of these rules. This skill will help you avoid numerous mistakes. If you check common guides, you will see that they contain lists of spelling rules. Below, you will find the ones that will help you achieve the best results:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Rule 1<\/strong>:\u00a0<\/em>\u00a0<em>When you add suffixes that begin with a vowel<\/em><em> (<\/em><em>\u2013<\/em><em>ible<\/em><em>, <\/em><em>-able,<\/em><em> \u2013<\/em><em>ous<\/em><em>, etc<\/em><em>.) <\/em><em>to having silent<\/em><em>\u00a0<strong>e<\/strong><\/em> at their end<em>, you need to omit the final<\/em><em>\u00a0<strong>e<\/strong>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This rule helps figure out why a word like\u00a0<em>desire\u00a0<\/em>has an\u00a0<em><strong>e<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0whereas a word <em>desirable<\/em>\u00a0has not. As for other examples, one should mention\u00a0<em>continue\u00a0<\/em>&#8211; <em>continuous, response &#8211;<\/em>\u00a0<em>responsible<\/em>.<br \/>\nHowever, it is necessary to retain the final\u00a0<em><strong>e<\/strong>\u00a0<\/em>when a word ends in\u2013<em>ge\u00a0or <\/em>\u2013<em>ce\u00a0<\/em>to maintain the clear pronunciation of these consonants:<\/p>\n<p><em>courage\u00a0<\/em>&#8211;\u00a0<em>courageous, notice\u00a0<\/em>&#8211;\u00a0<em>noticeable<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Rule 2<\/strong>:<\/em> <em><strong>I<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0<em>before<\/em><em>\u00a0<strong>e<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0(<em>except after<\/em><em>\u00a0<strong>c<\/strong>) or when sounded like <strong>ay<\/strong><\/em><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This rule explains the difference between the spellings of\u00a0<em>receive<\/em>\u00a0<em>and believe<\/em>. In general, when the long <em><strong>e<\/strong><\/em> sounds <em><strong>ee<\/strong><\/em><em>, it<\/em> is spelled with the letters\u00a0<em><strong>i<\/strong><\/em><strong><em>\u00a0<\/em><\/strong>and\u00a0<em><strong>e<\/strong><\/em>, the order is\u00a0<em><strong>ie<\/strong><\/em>:\u00a0<em>field, shield<\/em>.
