When writing a peer response, you will need to tell about your overall impression of another student\u2019s work. The task requires you to explain why you find some of the ideas exciting and others quite inaccurate. If you manage to succeed in peer review writing, you will significantly develop your analytical and critical thinking proficiency, establishing your credibility as a researcher.

You will probably need to read it twice or more times to understand its main strengths and weaknesses. If you are not sure how your peer review response should look like, you can follow the provided samples that will boost your writing inspiration. We strongly recommend you take this assignment seriously, as it takes a great part of the student\u2019s overall grade.<\/p>\n<p>Below, you will find a detailed guide on how to organize the process of writing a peer response:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the first part of your response, you will need to write a summary of your interpretation of the work you are reviewing. This section should sound very general telling about your overall impression of the work.<\/li>\n<li>Supporting examples. Once you provide your impression, you will need to justify your feedback by giving specific examples from the paper. For example, if you state that the work is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/blog\/how-to-write-a-persuasive-essay\/\">persuasive<\/a> enough, you need to explain what makes you think so. This means that you will need to explain which of the author\u2019s arguments sound appealing and what evidence has helped you understand it. When citing the ideas taken from the primary source, you will need to follow the rules of the citation style indicated in your prompt.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, you need to tell about your overall impression of the work again, which will help your audience understand what you think about it and if you recommend it for reading.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Writing a Peer Response: Additional Strategies<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Below, you will find additional clues that will help you create a perfect peer response:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to be maximally <a href=\"https:\/\/4writers.net\/blog\/objective-writing-professional-guidelines-and-tips\/\">objective<\/a>. When expressing your opinion on another author\u2019s piece of writing, you will need to be objective and unbiased. To do it, you will need to back up all of your arguments with appropriate examples from the piece;<\/li>\n<li>Use appropriate sentence starters. To help your audience enjoy reading your work, you will need to use appropriate transition words. This strategy will help you make the text of your response flow smoothly;<\/li>\n<li>Focus on more significant issues. Please, note that your task is to provide the overall picture of the work you are reviewing instead of analyzing each sentence. Therefore, we strongly recommend you read the work several times to understand what points you will discuss in your paper. Also, you may develop your arguments depending on the degree of their importance. This means that the content of the work is significant, whereas grammatical mistakes are just a minor concern;<\/li>\n<li>Use sufficient evidence. As it was already told, you should always back up your arguments. If you fail to support your arguments with good evidence, the author of the work may think that you are biased and prejudiced;<\/li>\n<li>Try to be maximally constructive. If you write, \u201cI like this post,\u201d you will not help the author improve their writing proficiency. Only if you manage to analyze the work thoroughly, you will help its author understand what areas should be improved;<\/li>\n<li>Use the \u201csandwich\u201d approach. According to this approach, you will need to write something positive at the very beginning of your response. Then, you will need to provide your objective criticism informing the author about the points that should be reconsidered. Finally, you will need to finalize your review on a positive and encouraging note;<\/li>\n<li>Be empathetic. Although this task should help you become a skilled reviewer, you should understand that the peer will read your feedback. They will feel embarrassed if your review sounds too negative. As such, we strongly recommend you choose a positive tone;<\/li>\n<li>Revise your work. Before you submit your review, you will need to revise it thoroughly. It will be awkward to criticize another person\u2019s work but submit a paper full of mistakes. Therefore, we strongly recommend you spend some time on an in-depth revision of your paper, as it will help you make a good impression on your readers.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Even the most skilled and creative academic writers cannot avoid writing multiple drafts before creating final versions of their papers.
