I was turning into a machine, a living robot with no interest in anything as I had to process the information and nobody would allow me to learn something new \u2013 there was no need for that. When I became an active writer, I got a new vision of work. I learned that since all of my essays will have to be unique, I had to research a lot to have them done. This had a secret meaning for me \u2013 I would have to learn something new every time I would work on the new assignment. This motivated me to become an active writer since this way I would be developing my knowledge and would keep the constant progress.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Financial Independence<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Initially, I doubted whether it is worth becoming a writer, as I believed that since there would be no fixed schedule, but a rather flexible one, this would not allow me to make enough money for living without maintaining a different job. However, once I started working, my view of the things changed dramatically. I do not have to work all day through to make as much as I need as I have a choice of the orders and can take the ones I can complete ASAP with the greatest price per page possible. This means that I can earn as much as I need within a really short period, and the time I save can be spent for any entertainment of my choice. Moreover, I can easily afford it since I made enough money working on the essays, and the entire world becomes open to me. This is how I managed to travel across numerous countries, visited ancient sites and took thousands of pictures so that my life definitely become more interesting. I believe that working with this company would allow me to eventually check all the places of interest all over the world.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Unbelievable Flexibility<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>There is no need to tell you that doing the job takes time. However, in my case, it is up to me when I wish to complete the assignment. When I take the job that has a long deadline, I can easily manage it in a few days, working on it part by part and ensuring I am on the right track by simple rereading. Since I am free to take breaks between work at any time, I can manage my day in a variety of ways based on my personal preferences. Therefore, every new day in my life is different, and life gets only better from this.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Don\u2019t wait, just ACT!!!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>My words may sound as if I described an imaginary situation, something that could not really happen, but it did. I truly hope you will not be losing time, thinking about this opportunity, but rather make a step forward, sign up and start learning, earning and enjoying your life today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have been working on multiple positions in the past years, but I could not stand staying in the same place and completing the same task over and over again for a long time.
