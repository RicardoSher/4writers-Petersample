Start right now!<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cThe scariest moment is always just before you start.\u201d (Stephen King) It may sound as simple as that but for some people it takes too long to decide where to take that first step. If you keep thinking instead of doing, you will never reach your goal. There is no time to hesitate whether you are skillful enough. Indeed, how do you know if you haven\u2019t even tried yet? So, here is the plan:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u00a0if you have no experience, do your research about freelance writing and learn as much as you can because knowledge is power;<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0give it a try first; there is no need to take any financial risks and quit your regular job until you feel confident enough to be a full-time freelance writer;<\/li>\n<li>update your resume and apply for a freelance job (for more information click here http:\/\/4writers.net\/);<\/li>\n<li>start taking your first jobs without any fear to be rejected \u2013 we all make mistakes but only those who accept their failure and keep going reach their final goals.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Be realistic but persistent.<\/h3>\n<p>Expecting to succeed and earn a fortune in a few days is not the best idea, especially if you have no experience. Try to do some self-evaluation first, and think how you can improve. Maybe your grammar is far from being perfect, or you haven\u2019t got the slightest idea how to format an article? Well, then you need to learn first. It\u2019s rather unlikely you are a genius and will start earning money from the moment you type something on your computer. Grab a good book or take an online course, do whatever it takes to be as proficient as possible. The truth to be told, if you want to be successful in a writing career, get ready to improve your skills and meet your own high standards every day!<\/p>\n<h3>3. Read a lot and write a lot!<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cRead, read, read. Read everything \u2013 trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read! You\u2019ll absorb it. Then write. If it\u2019s good, you\u2019ll find out. If it\u2019s not, throw it out of the window.\u201d (William Faulkner) The more you read, the easier it will be for you to express your thoughts. The more you express your thoughts in writing, the better writer you become. Try to develop your skills constantly, and one day you will see how much more confident you feel. You actually will be amazed how much faster you can write, and being speedy is a very useful skill for a freelancer. The less time you take to produce high quality writing the more money you can earn!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Be passionate!<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>And the last but not the least, no matter what you do, you need to love your craft \u2013 only then you will reach your goals. Being passionate about writing is probably the main key to your success in a freelance writing career. Being able to put away all your everyday troubles and focus on your writing at least a few hours a day is crucial.\u00a0 Try to concentrate on your topic and keep it in mind. Think about it while you are doing your everyday chores, walking along the street, driving a car, going out with friends, reading your favorite book or magazine, etc. Keep a pen and a little notebook in your pocket, and every time you have a new idea or run across a catchy quote, just put it down. Once you are in front of your computer ready to start writing, you will see how many ideas you already have. Now all you need is just to organize them, and produce a great piece of writing! Just imagine, you might have spent hours thinking about what to write and how to start\u2026 But now when you have all these precious thoughts and quotes in your notebook, you will finish your writing in no time!<\/p>\n<p>If you love writing, nothing should stop you from becoming a freelancer! There is no better feeling than doing what you love and being your own boss. So, all you need is just to give it a try!
