Either your supervisor gives you a choice or the customer does \u2013 you can always refuse to take anything that is not expensive enough or that you do not want to work on. Working on the orders, you can calculate your approximate salary and plan your expenses. This fact prevents a writer from a shock at the end of the month when he or she worries about rent, food, clothes and other aspects. If you are a self-employed freelance writer, you do not need to be bothered about it as you know how much you should be paid. If you need more money \u2013 you take more orders. If you need some rest and know that the sum you have earned will be sufficient, you can write less and enjoy your free time. Everything is simple.<\/p>\n<h3>Flexible working schedule<\/h3>\n<p>Many parents face the problem of taking a child to the kindergarten or from it and managing to be in the office during working hours. Freelancers do not have such problem. You can take a break any time you want if the deadline allows you to do it. A freelance writer decides by him\/herself when he\/she needs to write more to cope faster and when the research paper or essay can wait. You can go shopping or pick up a child whenever you need.<\/p>\n<p>One more advantage of flexible working schedule is the possibility to take days off or vacation any time you want. Have a doctor\u2019s appointment as 11 a.m.? \u2013 No problem! Go there without worrying about angry boss. Have a birthday on Wednesday, but do not feel like working and want to have a party? \u2013 Go for it! All you need to do it avoid taking any offers for that day. Want to go to the seaside at the middle of winter? \u2013 That is your decision to make and no one has a right to punish you. Being a freelance writer allows you to take control over your life instead of letting your work control it.<\/p>\n<h3>No boss to order<\/h3>\n<p>Being a freelance writer means that there is no person that can control you. Of course, there is a supervisor and a bunch of editors who check the papers, but they cannot order you taking some order or make you work from 9 to 5. They might just give you recommendations, so they are more like colleagues than the authority. You are your own boss and you are the one who controls the process. Isn\u2019t it great?<\/p>\n<h3>Constant learning<\/h3>\n<p>In order to write something, in most cases, you need to read something. Freelance writers produce papers on various topics, which means they are constantly developing as they read a lot. It is not possible to know everything you are going to write about, so you need to learn. The sense of development contributes to one\u2019s self-esteem. You feel that you do not degrade; your intelligence keeps boosting.<\/p>\n<h3>No need to commute or follow the fashion<\/h3>\n<p>Working as a freelance writer means that you write at home. In other words, you do not need to spend hours commuting or looking for the clothes appropriate for the office. You can wear pajamas all day long and no one will punish you for that. It does not mean you should do that. It is a great option for those who likes wearing jeans and sneakers instead of skirts and high heels.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, freelance writing may make feel you lonely as you do not communicate as much as you would have if you were working in the office, but it has many other advantages that will help you easily solve this little problem. Working at home allows you to save much time, design your schedule by yourself, take the orders you want, dress any way you want and plan your income. You are your own boss \u2013 what can be better? So, enjoy the writing process and earn money!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Working in the office has many benefits: you socialize with colleagues, have corporative parties, have a fixed working schedule (in many cases), etc. however, many people disregard this opportunity and opt for freelance job, especially freelance writing.
